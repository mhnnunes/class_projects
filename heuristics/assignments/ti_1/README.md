# Assignment 1  

The first assignment was to implement a constructive heuristic to the TSP.  

The dataset used in this assignment can be found on __[dataset](../dataset)__.  

The implemented heuristic follows a greedy approach, starting at the first city specified in the input. At each step, the closest city (the distance between cities is calculated depending on the method specified in the input file) is added to the path.
