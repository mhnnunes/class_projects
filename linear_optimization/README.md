# Linear Optimization  

This repository contains code used in the Linear Optimization class.  

The repository is divided into two directories:  
* 1.simplex  
  * This repository contains the implementation of the Simplex algorithm for solving Linear Programmings.  
* 2.max_flow  
  * This repository contains the implementation of two algorithms: the Ford-Fulkerson's algorithm for finding Maximum flow in a graph and an approximative algorithm for finding the Set Cover, by solving an Integer Programming problem.
